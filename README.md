# Portfolio Deployment Instructions

This portfolio is ready to be hosted for free on GitHub Pages.

## Steps to Deploy

1.  **Create a GitHub Repo**:
    *   Go to GitHub.com and create a new repository (e.g., `portfolio`).
    *   Make sure it is **Public**.

2.  **Upload Files**:
    *   Upload `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js` to this repository.

3.  **Enable GitHub Pages**:
    *   Go to your repository **Settings**.
    *   Click on **Pages** in the left sidebar.
    *   Under **Source**, select `main` (or `master`) branch.
    *   Click **Save**.

4.  **Get Your URL**:
    *   After a minute, refresh the page. You will see a link like `https://yourusername.github.io/portfolio`.
    *   **This is the URL you put on your resume!**

## Customization
*   Edit `index.html` to update links (Resume PDF, LinkedIn URL).
*   Add your real resume PDF file to the folder and link to it in `index.html`.
